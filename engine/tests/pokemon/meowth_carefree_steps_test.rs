/// The key behavior (and the bug this fixes): on a heads flip only the *damage* to Meowth is
/// prevented — the rest of the attack (here, the Poison from Grimer's Poison Gas) still happens.
/// Previously the heads branch dropped the whole attack, including its effects.
///
/// We drive the attack across many RNG seeds and assert:
/// - Meowth is ALWAYS poisoned (the secondary effect resolves regardless of the coin), and
/// - Meowth's remaining HP is sometimes full (heads, damage prevented) and sometimes reduced
///   (tails, 10 damage), proving the prevention coin actually fires.
